# Excercise - 1 | Sprint Time - 5 minutes

## 1. As a fan of Mathematician I want to calculateArea and calculateCircumference of a given with circle radius (r)
1. When R = 4
2. When R = 10
2. When R = 0

Hint: formula to calculateArea = 3.14 * r * r

Hint: formula to calculateCircumference = 2 * 3.14 * r
